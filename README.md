# Logistics Website

A comprehensive logistics shipment platform built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB. This project consists of three separate apps:

1. **Main Shipment Website** — for customers to book shipments.
2. **Admin Dashboard** — for administrators to manage orders, users, and contact form submissions.
3. **Delivery Agent App** — for delivery personnel to view assigned pickups and deliveries filtered by city.

## 🚀 Features

### 🛒 User Flow (Main Website)
- **Shipment Form**: Users provide personal details, departure and delivery cities, freight type, weight, insurance choice, and delivery speed (express or standard).
- **Box Selection**: Users pick an appropriate box based on parcel dimensions to account for weight vs. size discrepancies.
- **Checkout**: Enter sender and receiver details.
- **Payment Integration**: Seamless Razorpay payment integration (currently in test mode).
- **Order Confirmation**: Users receive an Order ID for tracking and see a confirmation page after successful payment.
- **Tracking**: Order ID can be used for tracking purposes.

### 🛠️ Admin Dashboard
- View all orders with detailed information.
- Search functionality to quickly find orders by order ID or customer details.
- View messages from the contact form.
- Login/signup functionality for admin authentication.

### 🚚 Delivery Agent App
- Delivery agents can:
  - Select their city.
  - View pickup and delivery orders specific to their assigned city.
  - Mark orders as picked up/delivered (if implemented in future).

## 💰 Price Calculation Logic

The shipping cost is calculated dynamically using the following steps:

1. **Distance-Based Pricing**  
   - A pre-calculated distance matrix determines the distance between major Indian cities.
   - Shipping cost scales with distance.

2. **Weight Calculation**  
   - Both actual weight and volumetric weight (based on selected box dimensions) are calculated.
   - The chargeable weight is the higher of the two.

3. **Base Rate**  
   - A base rate per kilogram applies and varies with distance.

4. **Add-Ons and Surcharges**  
   - Express delivery and insurance add fixed surcharges.

5. **Total Cost**  
   ```
   Shipping Price = (Base Rate × Chargeable Weight) + Add-ons
   ```
